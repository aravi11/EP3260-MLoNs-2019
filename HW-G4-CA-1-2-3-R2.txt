\f0\fs24 \cf0 This group completed the all assignments good. There are some suggestions that can be useful to make the implementations more useful.\

Unfortunately, I liked to see the formula that you used to compute the closed-form solution, but I did not see it. Why did you compute hessian? Also I did not see the difference between the two solution for two different data sets.\

I think if you could give one figure which shows all the plots (lines of costs) for different solvers, then we could see the difference easier and compare them. You did not give any explanation about how you tuned the lambda parameter. After tuning the lambda, which lambda do you suggest and why?\

\
Same as previous one. :)\
